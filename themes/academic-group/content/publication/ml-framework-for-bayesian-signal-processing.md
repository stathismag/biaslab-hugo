abstract = "In this thesis, we present a Bayesian machine learning framework for  signal  processing,  based  on  variational  message  passing.   The developed framework and its open-source software implementation allow building generative models using a set of building blocks, and doing  inference  on  them  using  variational  message  passing.   The capabilities of the framework are being demonstrated on several applications, such as speech denoising and image segmentation. The main contribution of this work is the newly developed framework that incorporates means for model specification, probabilistic inference and model comparison, and focuses on solving signal processing tasks.  The framework is capable of working with multivariate  continuous  data,  and  is  expandable  enough  to  solve  complex real-world problems."
