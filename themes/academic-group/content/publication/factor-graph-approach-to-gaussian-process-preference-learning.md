abstract = "Gaussian  Process  Preference  Learning  (GPPL)  is considered to be the state-of-the-art algorithm for learning about a  personâ€™s  preferences  over  a  continuous domain  of tunableparameter values. Unfortunately, the existing literature is vague about  the  underlying  modular  structure  of  the  full  algorithm. This hinders application of GPPL to embedded environments or to new application domains. We describe the GPPL algorithm as a Forney-style Factor Graph (FFG), which is a formal framework for  distributed  signal  processing  (and  probabilistic  inference) in a graph of sub-components. One of the benefits of the FFG-based specification of GPPL is that the algorithm can easily be changed to the specific circumstances of the application. We demonstrate the  FFG-based  GPPL  algorithm  in  MATLAB  by  a  perceptual tuning problem for a noise suppression algorithm."
