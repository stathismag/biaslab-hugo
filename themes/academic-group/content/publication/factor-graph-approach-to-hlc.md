abstract = "In  modern  hearing  aids,  Hearing  Loss  Compensation  (HLC)  is  implemented  by  dynamic  range  compression circuits.  Although  this  approach  provides  reasonable  results,  it is unable to computationally link the compensation algorithm to the hearing loss problem. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that describes HLC as a probabilistic inference problem and  automatically  infers  the  solution  using  message  passing  on a  factor  graph.  We  show  that  using  this  approach  we  can  not only derive an unique solution for a specified hearing loss model, but we can also solve the parameter estimation (a.k.a. fitting) as demonstrated by a simulation example. The proposed approach allows  straightforward  substitution  by  alternative  hearing  loss models,  and  can  be  applied  to  other  signal  processing  applications."
